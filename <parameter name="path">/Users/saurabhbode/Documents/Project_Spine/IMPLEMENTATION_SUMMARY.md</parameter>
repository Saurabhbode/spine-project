## Task Completed: Finance Manager Dashboard Restructuring

### What Was Done:

1. **Created a modular file structure** for the Finance Manager Dashboard with separate files for each sidebar button/page

2. **Created Files:**
   - `src/components/dashboard/FinanceManagerDashboard.jsx` - Main dashboard component (refactored)
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/` - New directory for finance manager modules
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/components/Sidebar.jsx` - Reusable sidebar component
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Dashboard home page
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/pages/Invoices.jsx` - Invoices management page
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/pages/ProjectOverview.jsx` - Project overview page
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/pages/Employees.jsx` - Employees management page
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/pages/Users.jsx` - Users management page
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/FinanceManager.css` - Styles for finance dashboard
   - `src/components/dashboard/finance-manager/index.js` - Barrel file for easy imports

3. **Sidebar Buttons Implemented:**
   - Dashboard
   - Invoices
   - Project Overview
   - Employees
   - Users

### Benefits of This Structure:

- **Modular**: Each page is in its own file, making it easier to develop and maintain
- **Reusable**: Sidebar component can be reused across different dashboards
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new pages by creating new files
- **Clean**: Separation of concerns between navigation and page content
- **Maintainable**: Easier to debug and update individual components

### How to Use:

The dashboard now uses a state-based navigation system:
```jsx
import FinanceManagerDashboard from './components/dashboard/FinanceManagerDashboard';

function App() {
  return <FinanceManagerDashboard />;
}
```

Each page component (Dashboard, Invoices, etc.) can be developed independently with their own logic and UI.

### Next Steps:

1. Implement actual functionality in each page component
2. Add API calls to backend services
3. Enhance UI with more detailed components
4. Add data tables, charts, and other UI elements as needed
5. Test the navigation between pages

### Files Created:
- 1 main dashboard file (refactored)
- 1 sidebar component
- 5 page components
- 1 CSS file
- 1 index/barrel file
- 2 documentation/plan files

**Total: 11 new files created**
